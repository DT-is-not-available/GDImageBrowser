#### Contributing
If you want to contribute, submit a pull request. I'll probably accept all of them. If you want to submit more descriptions of blocks, do so in `assets/custom/descriptions.json`.

#### How it works
It's very self-explanatory. Just hover over the block in the spritesheet (which can be changed in the top left), and the program will tell you what block it is. To download a block, right click on the image preview and click "Save As" or "Copy" or something similar.
